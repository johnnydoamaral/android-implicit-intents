# android-implicit-intents
Basic app that receives an implicit intent

This is a very simple project just to show the use of Implicit Intents. It can receive an action_send with the mime type "text/pain".
In this case it displays text received from other application (for example, using the share button).
Once you hit the share button in the other application and choose this application in the menu, the text will be displayed in the main screen.
